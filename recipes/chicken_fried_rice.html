        <li>2 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>1 cup mixed vegetables (carrots, peas, corn, and/or bell peppers)</li>

        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Recipe</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>If using day-old rice, fluff it with a fork to separate the grains. If using fresh rice, cook it according to the package instructions and let it cool down before using in the recipe.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet or wok, heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Add the diced chicken and cook until it turns golden brown and is cooked through. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Remove the cooked chicken from the skillet and set it aside.</li>
        <li>In the same skillet or wok, add another tablespoon of vegetable oil if needed.</li>
        <li>Pour the beaten eggs into the skillet and scramble them until they are just cooked. Remove the scrambled eggs from the skillet and set them aside with the cooked chicken.</li>
        <li>In the same skillet or wok, add the remaining tablespoon of vegetable oil if needed.</li>
        <li>Add the minced garlic and ginger, and saut√© for about 1 minute until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Stir in the mixed vegetables and cook until they are tender-crisp.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked rice to the skillet with the vegetables. Stir-fry everything together, breaking up any clumps of rice.</li>
        <li>Drizzle the soy sauce and oyster sauce (if using) over the rice and vegetables. Mix well until the sauces are evenly distributed.</li>
        <li>Return the cooked chicken and scrambled eggs to the skillet with the rice. Mix everything together, ensuring the chicken and eggs are evenly distributed throughout the fried rice.</li>
        <li>Drizzle the sesame oil over the fried rice, giving it a wonderful aromatic flavor.</li>
        <li>Toss in the chopped green onions (scallions) and give the fried rice one final stir to incorporate all the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Transfer the chicken fried rice to serving plates or bowls.</li>
        <li>Optionally, garnish with additional chopped green onions for extra freshness.</li>
