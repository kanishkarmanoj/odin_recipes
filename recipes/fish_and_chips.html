    <h2>Fish and chips is a classic British dish consisting of battered and deep-fried white fish served with crispy golden fries, enjoyed worldwide for its delightful taste and comforting simplicity.</h2>
    <p>Fish and chips is an iconic and beloved British dish that embodies the perfect marriage of crispy and tender textures, coupled with delectable flavors. This classic meal typically consists of a generous fillet of white fish, traditionally cod or haddock, coated in a light and crispy batter, then deep-fried to golden perfection. The fish is served alongside thick-cut, fluffy potato chips, known as fries in other parts of the world. The contrast between the crunchy outer layer of the fish and the succulent, flaky interior creates a delightful culinary experience. The golden fries, seasoned with a sprinkle of salt, complement the fish beautifully. Often served with a side of tartar sauce or mushy peas for added zest and freshness, fish and chips remains a timeless comfort food, enjoyed at coastal shops, local pubs, and restaurants worldwide.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 white fish fillets (such as cod or haddock), about 6 ounces each</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour, for dredging</li>
        <li>1/4 cup cornstarch or baking powder, for the batter</li>
        <li>1 cup cold water or beer (sparkling water works too), for the batter</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil, for frying</li>
        <li>4 large potatoes (Russet or other starchy varieties), peeled and cut into thick strips</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil, for frying</li>
        <li>Salt, for seasoning</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Recipe</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the cut potato strips in cold water to remove excess starch. Pat them dry with a paper towel.</li>
        <li>In a deep pan or deep fryer, heat vegetable oil to 350°F (175°C).</li>
        <li>Carefully add the potato strips to the hot oil in batches to avoid overcrowding. Fry the chips for about 4-6 minutes or until they turn golden and crispy.</li>
        <li>Remove the fried chips from the oil using a slotted spoon and place them on a plate lined with paper towels to drain any excess oil. Season with salt while they're still hot.</li>
        <li>In a shallow dish, season the all-purpose flour with a pinch of salt and pepper. Dredge each fish fillet in the flour, shaking off any excess.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the cornstarch or baking powder, cold water or beer, 1 teaspoon of salt, and 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper to make the batter. Ensure the batter is smooth and lump-free.</li>
        <li>Dip each floured fish fillet into the batter, coating it evenly.</li>
        <li>In a deep pan or deep fryer, heat vegetable oil to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>Carefully add the battered fish fillets to the hot oil, a few at a time. Fry the fish for about 4-6 minutes, turning once, until the batter turns crisp and golden, and the fish is cooked through. The internal temperature should reach 145°F (63°C).</li>
        <li>Remove the fried fish from the oil using a slotted spoon and place them on a plate lined with paper towels to drain any excess oil.</li>
    </ol>
