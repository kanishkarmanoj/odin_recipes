    <h2>Fried Chicken is a common staple food for many across the world and is fairly simple to make.</h2>
    <p>Fried chicken is a beloved and classic dish that features tender, juicy pieces of chicken coated in a crispy and seasoned outer layer. The preparation starts with marinating bone-in chicken pieces in a mixture of buttermilk and spices, enhancing the chicken's flavor and tenderness. The coating is typically made from a blend of all-purpose flour and a combination of spices, adding a delightful kick of flavor. Once the chicken is thoroughly coated, it is deep-fried to perfection until the outside turns golden brown and crispy, while the inside remains moist and succulent. The irresistible aroma of the fried chicken fills the air, making it hard to resist. This delightful dish is often served as a main course, accompanied by various side dishes like coleslaw, mashed potatoes, or biscuits. Fried chicken is not only a delicious comfort food but also a symbol of warm gatherings and happy moments shared with family and friends.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 to 3 pounds of bone-in chicken pieces (drumsticks, thighs, or wings)</li>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional, for a bit of spice)</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil (for frying)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, pour the buttermilk over the chicken pieces, making sure they are fully coated. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or ideally overnight. This step helps tenderize and flavor the chicken.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, mix together the all-purpose flour, garlic powder, paprika, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper (if using). Stir well to ensure even distribution of the spices.</li>
        <li>Take each marinated chicken piece and allow any excess buttermilk to drip off. Roll the chicken in the flour mixture, ensuring it is coated thoroughly. Gently shake off any excess flour.</li>
        <li>In a deep, heavy-bottomed pot or skillet, pour enough vegetable oil to submerge the chicken pieces. Heat the oil over medium-high heat until it reaches 350째F (175째C).</li>
        <li>Carefully add the coated chicken pieces to the hot oil, a few at a time, to avoid overcrowding the pot. Fry the chicken in batches if necessary.</li>
        <li>Fry the chicken for about 12 to 15 minutes, turning occasionally, until the outside is golden brown and crispy, and the internal temperature reaches 165째F (74째C). Cooking times may vary depending on the size of the chicken pieces.</li>
        <li>Once the chicken is cooked, use tongs to remove it from the oil and place it on a plate lined with paper towels to absorb any excess oil.</li>
        <li>Let the fried chicken rest for a few minutes before serving to retain its juiciness and crispiness.</li>
        <li>Serve the delicious fried chicken hot as a main course, and enjoy it with your favorite side dishes and sauces.</li>
    </ol>
